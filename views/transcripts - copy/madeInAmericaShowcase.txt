THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you, Mike. \'a0And you know, Mike, it is true that, as I walked through the halls, we saw so many great companies, but the gentleman who was in charge of Omaha Beef -- they do beef -- he hugged me, he wanted to kiss me so badly. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0Because he said, our business is a whole different business now because you got China approved; the other administrations couldn\'92t even come close. \'a0And I told him, you know how long it took? \'a0One sentence. \'a0I said, President Xi, we\'92d love to sell beef back in China again. \'a0He said, you can do that. \'a0That was the end of that. \'a0Right? \'a0(Applause.) \'a0Sonny. \'a0The great Sonny Perdue. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0So we\'92re very happy.\uc0\u8232 \'a0\'a0\u8232 But we\'92re here today to celebrate American manufacturing and to showcase the amazing products from all 50 states, made in the USA. \'a0Remember in the old days they used to have "Made in the USA", "Made in America"? \'a0But made in the USA. \'a0We\'92re going to start doing that again. \'a0We\'92re going to put that brand on our product because it means it\'92s the best. \'a0\
In just a few months and moments, I will say what we\'92ve done over a short period of time and what we\'92re going to be doing over the next six months will be incredible. \'a0\
We\'92ve signed more bills -- and I\'92m talking about through the legislature -- than any President ever. \'a0For a while, Harry Truman had us, and now I think we have everybody, Mike. \'a0I better say "think," otherwise they\'92ll give me a Pinocchio -- (laughter) -- and I don\'92t like those -- I don\'92t like Pinocchios. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0\
In just a few moments, I\'92ll be signing a Presidential Proclamation to launch \'93Made in America Week\'94 and to make today \'93Made in America Day.\'94\
We are thrilled to be joined today by so many incredible members of my Cabinet. \'a0Every member of my administration shares the same goal: \'a0to provide a level playing field for American workers and for American industry. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0And we are providing it much faster than other countries would like. \'a0So it\'92s been really a pleasure. \'a0\
We want to build, create, and grow more products in our country using American labor, American goods, and American grit. \'a0When we purchase products made in the USA, the profits stay here, the revenue stays here, and the jobs -- maybe most importantly of all -- they stay right here in the USA. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0\
In the audience today we have skilled workers, we have business leaders whose American-made goods we are proudly displaying all over the White House and outside. \'a0I saw fire engines. \'a0I saw tractors from Caterpillar. \'a0I saw some incredible machinery. \'a0Make it right here. \'a0We thank you for being here. \'a0We\'92re honored to showcase your creations. \'a0And I will say, they\'92ve really taken on, and some of you have built names that I know of for so long. \'a0And its -- congratulations. \'a0Right? \'a0You in particular. \'a0What a great job you\'92ve done. \'a0Thank you very much. \'a0And I saw you on television this morning. \'a0You were fantastic. \'a0I don\'92t know what you\'92re doing, exactly, but you could always have a second career. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0You did a great job. \'a0Thank you very much.\'a0\
American workers, farmers, and innovators are really the best in the world -- we know that. \'a0And what we\'92re doing [with] that is we\'92re displaying those talents. \'a0You construct and harvest the products that fill our homes, feed our families, and defend our nation, and enrich our lives. \'a0I want to make a pledge to each and every one of you: \'a0No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth -- and it has been drained. \'a0It has been drained. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0\
You\'92re going to see a lot of things happening over the next six months -- you know, statutorily and through a lot of different legal -- through the legal process. \'a0It takes a while to get it set so that you\'92re allowed to do it. \'a0You\'92re not allowed to do, but we\'92ve now mostly fulfilled all of that. \'a0And over the next short period of time, you\'92re going to see things announced that you won\'92t even believe for our country and for selling product in our country and making product in our country, and things that are great for American jobs. \'a0You\'92re going to be seeing that happening really quickly because we are totally set up, and the hard part now is done. \'a0It is a long, horrible process, but we\'92re going to also get rid of some of that process for the future. \'a0But we\'92re going to stand up for our companies and, maybe most importantly, for our workers. \'a0\
For decades, Washington has allowed other nations to wipe out millions of American jobs through unfair trade practices. \'a0Wait until you see what\'92s up for you. \'a0You are going to be so happy. \'a0This painful exodus of American jobs -- and I\'92ve been talking about it for years -- was also marked by a period of sluggish growth, falling incomes, surging welfare, and shrinking participation in the workforce. \'a0Clearly, it\'92s time for a new policy -- one defined by two simple rules: \'a0We will buy American and we will hire American. \'a0Right, Governor? \'a0(Applause.) \'a0\
My administration is removing the burdens and regulations on your companies so that you can compete, thrive, and grow. \'a0How many of you have noticed this so far? \'a0Because it\'92s a big, big difference, right? \'a0That\'92s a big, big difference. \'a0The people are coming up to me -- they can\'92t even believe it. \'a0We took the farmer\'92s land away. \'a0We took the homebuilder\'92s land away. \'a0They have their land back now, and they\'92re building homes and they\'92re farming their farms, and it\'92s a beautiful thing to see. \'a0And they\'92re so thankful. \'a0\
So a lot of those regulations have been taken off; the rest are coming off. \'a0And, by the way, we will have better protection than we've ever had, but we\'92ll also have something where you don\'92t have to wait 15 years for a permit and then when you go to the board, you lose. \'a0And that\'92s a big portion of your life wiped out waiting for a permit. \'a0We\'92re not going to let that happen. \'a0\
But for our nation to really prosper, we must lower the tax on business -- one of the highest in the world -- and we must repeal job-killing Obamacare. \'a0We have to do that. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0And I can tell you, we hope John McCain gets better very soon because we miss him. \'a0He\'92s a crusty voice in Washington. \'a0Plus, we need his vote. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0And he\'92ll be back. \'a0And he will be back sooner than somebody else would be back. \'a0He\'92ll be back soon. \'a0\
But we need that vote. \'a0And we need a number of votes because we do have to repeal Obamacare, and we will end up replacing it with something that is going to be outstanding -- far, far better than failing Obamacare where premiums have gone up, in some cases over 200 percent this year; where every single element of it is bad, and the insurance companies, by the way, are fleeing, so people have -- in some states you have no insurance companies. \'a0\
And we have some governors here, and we have senators here, and we have congressmen here, and women -- and I will tell you, it\'92s a very, very hard time they\'92re having with the Obamacare situation. \'a0So we\'92re going to get that done, and I think we\'92re going to surprise a lot of people. \'a0But they\'92re pushing very hard. \'a0The Republican senators are great people, but they have a lot of different states. \'a0Some states need this, some states need that. \'a0But we\'92re getting it together, and it\'92s going to happen. \'a0Right, Mike? \'a0\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0I think. \'a0(Laughter and applause.) \'a0And when it does happen, that will be a big day in America, believe me. \'a0A big day in America. \'a0 \'a0\
But we must also fight the unfair trade practices that have gutted our industry, and that includes cracking down on the predatory online sales of foreign goods, which is absolutely killing our shoppers and our shopping centers. \'a0If you look at what\'92s going on with shopping centers and stores and jobs in stores, it\'92s been very, very tough for them. \'a0They\'92ve had a very hard time. \'a0Closing at numbers and records that have never been seen before. \'a0So we have to stop that -- the online predatory practices.\
Since the beginning of the year, we have already created over 50,000 brand-new manufacturing jobs, and we're just getting started. \'a0We will lift our citizens from welfare to work. \'a0We will turn boarded-up communities into new outposts of American commerce. \'a0And we will once again rediscover our heritage as a manufacturing nation. \'a0We used to be a manufacturing nation. \'a0Not so much anymore. \'a0But I will tell you, if you look at Michigan, if you look at some states that have really moved -- you know, in Pennsylvania, two weeks ago they opened the mine -- the first mine that was opened in decades. \'a0Opened a mine.\'a0\
And you know all the people that were saying the mining jobs? \'a0Well, we picked up 45,000 mining jobs in a very short period of time. \'a0And everybody was saying, well, you won\'92t get any mining jobs. \'a0We picked up 45,000 mining jobs, and the miners are very happy with Trump and with Pence. \'a0And we're very proud of that. \'a0But that's just the beginning. \'a0We have jobs coming from all over.\
Restoring American manufacturing will not only restore our wealth, it will restore our pride and pride in ourselves. \'a0It will revitalize our independence, and it will rebuild the bonds of kinship between our communities and our citizens, which has been lagging, wouldn\'92t you say?\
For most of our nation\'92s history, American -- and we see this -- American Presidents have understood that in order to protect our economy and our security, we must protect our industry. \'a0And much of that comes at the border. \'a0George Washington encouraged Americans to produce their own goods so that our young nation could become truly independent.\
President James Garfield said, of our nation\'92s manufacturers, that, \'93to them the country owes the splendor of the position it holds before the world\'94 -- meaning, protect us.\
Theodore Roosevelt declared in his first message to Congress that "reciprocity" -- my favorite word, reciprocity -- because we have countries that charge us 100 percent tax on a product, and when that product is sold by them to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing. \'a0And people say, oh, that's free trade. \'a0No, that's stupid trade. \'a0That's really stupid trade. \'a0(Applause.)\'a0\
It\'92s incredible. \'a0You\'92ll actually have people who -- "No, we can't do that. \'a0That's free trade." \'a0It\'92s just -- that's so incredible, but what are you going to do. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0Oh, what happens in Washington, you just wouldn\'92t believe the things. \'a0\
But \'93reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection.\'94 \'a0And William McKinley proclaimed that \'93we ought to take care of our own nation and her industries first.\'94 \'a0We have to look at our nation first for a change. \'a0We've been looking the other way for a long, long time. \'a0And if you look at what\'92s going on or the success of other nations -- even in Europe -- you look at some of those countries, one in particular, it\'92s not fair to the United States. \'a0\
And that's why I\'92m here, and I believe it\'92s one of the primary reasons you elected me and Mike. \'a0I mean, that's why we're here. \'a0And I think you're going to see a big, big -- I don't think -- I don't think -- I know you're going to see one of the great differences, and you're already seeing it, but it\'92s going to get more so and more so. \'a0And we're going to end up having a level playing field.\
I don't want to say any more than level. \'a0But if the playing field were slanted like a little bit toward us, I\'92d accept that also. \'a0Okay? \'a0(Applause.)\'a0\
So, once again, we will celebrate craftsmen, producers, and innovators like the incredible men and women in this room today. \'a0We will protect our workers, promote our industry, and be proud of our history because we will put America first. \'a0America will be first again. \'a0We will make America great again. \'a0Remember that. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0And we\'92ll meet in this same room in a year and in two years, and you\'92ll see what happened. \'a0\
Thank you for all being here. \'a0God bless you and God bless America. \'a0Thank you very much. \'a0Thank you, thank you. \'a0(Applause.)\
(The President moves to the signing desk.)\'a0\
So this is being signed in honor of Made in America Day and Made in America Week, and soon we\'92re going to have Made in America Decades. \'a0We're going to have a lot of tremendous success, and it\'92s already just starting to kick in. \'a0\
You see it with the job numbers. \'a0You see it with the stock market, which hit an all-time high every day for quite a while now. \'a0You see it with so many other things. \'a0And most importantly perhaps, you see it with the manufacturers. \'a0Their level of enthusiasm is greater now than at any time since they've been taking this type of poll, and I believe it\'92s 28 years old. \'a0So people are enthused. \'a0Are you all enthused? \'a0(Applause.)\'a0\
Thank you all for being here.\
(The document is signed.) \'a0\
