PRESIDENT XI: (No English translation provided.)\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, thank you, Mr. President.\'a0And on behalf of the United States, I would like to just say that it's an honor to have gotten to know you.\'a0We are developing, and have developed, a wonderful relationship.\'a0I appreciate the things that you have done relevant to the very substantial problem that we all face in North Korea -- a problem that something has to be done about.\'a0And I'm sure that whether it's on trade or whether it's on North Korea, or any of the many things that we will be discussing, we will come to a successful conclusion.\
Trade is, as you know, as very, very big issue for the United States now, because for years, and certainly over a long period of time, many things have happened that have led to trade imbalances.\'a0And we're going to turn that around.\'a0And I know that China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal.\
As far as North Korea is concerned, we will have, eventually, success.\'a0It may take longer than I\'92d like.\'a0It may take longer than you'd like.\'a0But there will be success in the end one way or the other.\
I want to thank you very much for inviting us.\'a0And again, it's an honor to get to know you and your wife, a really wonderful woman.\'a0And it's an honor to have you as a friend.\
Thank you very much.\
