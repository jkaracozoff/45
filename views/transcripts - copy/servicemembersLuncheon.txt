THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you very much. \'a0I\'92m pleased to have Vice President Pence with us and four great soldiers who spent a lot of time in Afghanistan. \'a0And I\'92m going to be talking to you about Afghanistan -- what you think, your views. \'a0These are people on the ground -- know it probably better than anybody. \'a0You know it pretty well, right? \'a0\
And we\'92re going to be getting some ideas because we\'92ve been there -- it\'92s our longest war -- we\'92ve been there for many years. \'a0We\'92ve been there for now close to 17 years, and I want to find out why we\'92ve been there for 17 years, how it\'92s going, and what we should do in terms of additional ideas. \'a0I\'92ve heard plenty of ideas from a lot of people, but I want to hear it from the people on the ground. \'a0\
So this is actually a very important luncheon, and it\'92s a great honor to have you with us. \'a0And I look forward to the discussion. \'a0We\'92ll wait until the media leaves.\
I want to thank you, folks. \'a0Thank you very much. \'a0Thank you.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Disappointed. \'a0Very disappointed. \'a0\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0I don\'92t think it\'92s dead, no. \'a0But I\'92m certainly disappointed. \'a0For seven years, I\'92ve been hearing "repeal and replace" from Congress, and I\'92ve been hearing it loud and strong. \'a0And then when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, they don\'92t take advantage of it. \'a0So that\'92s disappointing. \'a0\
So I\'92m very -- I would say I\'92m disappointed in what took place. \'a0We\'92ll go on and we\'92ll win -- we\'92re going to win on taxes, we\'92re going to win on infrastructure, and lots of other things that we\'92re doing. \'a0We\'92ve won and are winning the war, as you know, at the border. \'a0We are very much decimating ISIS. \'a0You can see that -- you see that better than anybody sees it -- the soldiers that are with us today. \'a0\
We\'92ve had a lot of victories, but we haven\'92t had a victory on healthcare. \'a0We\'92re disappointed. \'a0I am very disappointed because, again, even as a civilian, for seven years I\'92ve been hearing about healthcare, and I\'92ve been hearing about repeal and replace. \'a0And Obamacare is a total disaster. \'a0Some states had over a 200 percent increase -- a 200 percent increase -- in their premiums, and their deductibles are through the roof. \'a0It\'92s an absolute disaster.\
And I think you\'92ll also agree that I\'92ve been saying for a long time: \'a0Let Obamacare fail and then everybody is going to have to come together and fix it and come up with a new plan and a plan that\'92s really good for the people with much lower premiums, much lowers costs, and much better protection. \'a0\
I\'92ve been saying that -- Mike, I think you\'92ll agree -- for a long time. \'a0Let Obamacare fail. \'a0It will be a lot easier. \'a0And I think we\'92re probably in that position where we\'92ll just let Obamacare fail. \'a0We\'92re not going to own it. \'a0I\'92m not going to own it. \'a0I can tell you, the Republicans are not going to own it. \'a0We\'92ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us, and they\'92re going to say, "How do we fix it? \'a0How do we fix it? \'a0Or how do we come up with a new plan?"\
So we\'92ll see what happens. \'a0There\'92s some other things going on right now as we speak, but I am disappointed because, for so many years, I\'92ve been hearing repeal and replace. \'a0I\'92m sitting in the Oval Office, right next door, pen in hand, waiting to sign something, and I\'92ll be waiting. \'a0And eventually we\'92re going to get something done, and it\'92s going to be very good. \'a0\
But Obamacare is a big failure, and it has to be changed. \'a0We have to go to a plan that works. \'a0We have to go to a much less expensive plan, in terms of premiums. \'a0And something will happen and it will be very good. \'a0It may not be as quick as we had hoped, but it\'92s going to happen.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Well, they were not disloyal, they had their own reasons. \'a0I was very surprised when the two folks came out last night, because we thought they were in fairly good shape, but they did. \'a0And, you know, everybody has their own reason. \'a0\
But if you really think about it, you look at it, and we have 52 people -- we had no Democrat support, which is really something that should be said. \'a0We should have had Democrats voted. \'a0It's a great plan for a lot of people. \'a0We had no Democrat support. \'a0We have 52 people; we had four "No's." \'a0Now, we might have had another one somewhere in there. \'a0But essentially, the vote would have been pretty close to -- if you look at it -- 48-4. \'a0That's a pretty impressive vote by any standard. \'a0And yet you have a vote of 48-4, or something like that, and you need more -- that's pretty tough.\
So the way I look at it is, in '18 we're going to have to get some more people elected. \'a0We have to go out and we have to get more people elected that are Republican. \'a0And we have to probably pull in those people -- those few people that voted against it. \'a0I don\'92t know, they're going to have to explain to you why they did, and I'm sure they'll have very fine reasons. \'a0But we have to get more Republicans elected because we have to get it done. \'a0\
We passed it in the House. \'a0We would have gotten it very much -- yeah, you can't use his stand as a stand, right? \'a0We don\'92t want that to happen. \'a0You're messing with the wrong guy here. \'a0\
So we want -- I think we're going to do very well, actually, in '18. \'a0I would be not surprised if something were done long before that. \'a0But in any event, because the margin is so small -- the majority margin is so small -- we're going to have to go out and get more Republicans elected in '18, and I'll be working very hard for that happen, okay? \'a0\
It would be nice to have Democrat support, but, really, they're obstructionists. \'a0They have no ideas. \'a0They have no thought process. \'a0All they want to do is obstruct the government and obstruct, period. \'a0And, in this case, think of it -- so many good things. \'a0We didn\'92t get one vote. \'a0And their plan has failed.\
And, by the way, Obamacare isn't failing -- it's failed. \'a0Done. \'a0So I think something is going to happen. \'a0We'll find out. \'a0Stay tuned. \'a0Thank you all very much.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0No.\
