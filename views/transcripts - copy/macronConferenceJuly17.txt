PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0Well thank you very much, President Macron. \'a0And Melania and I are thrilled to join you and Mrs. Macron. \'a0This is a wonderful national celebration, and we look very much forward to it. \'a0It will be spectacular. \'a0Tomorrow -- Bastille Day. \'a0\
We\'92re honored to be here in your beautiful country -- and it certainly is a beautiful country -- with its proud history and its magnificent people. \'a0And thank you for the tour of some of the most incredible buildings anywhere in the world. \'a0That was very, very -- a very beautiful thing to see. \'a0Thank you.\
When the French people rose up and stormed the Bastille, it changed the course of human history. \'a0Our two nations are forever joined together by the spirit of revolution and the fight for freedom. \'a0France is America\'92s first and oldest ally. \'a0A lot of people don\'92t know that. \'a0Ever since General Lafayette joined the American fight for independence, our fates and fortunes have been tied unequivocally together. \'a0It was a longtime ago but we are together, and I think together, perhaps, more so than ever. \'a0The relationship is very good.\
This visit also commemorates another milestone. \'a0One century ago, the United States entered World War I. \'a0And when the President called me, he had mentioned that fact -- 100 years ago, that was -- I said, Mr. President, I will be there. \'a0That\'92s a big, important date -- 100 years. \'a0\
We remember the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives in that valiant and very difficult struggle. \'a0We also pay tribute to the heroic deeds of the French Troops whose courage at the Battle of Marne, and countless other battles, will never be forgotten by us. \'a0More than one million French soldiers laid down their lives in defense of liberty. \'a0Their sacrifice is an eternal tribute to France and to freedom. \'a0French and American patriots have fought together, bled together, and died together in the fight for our countries and our civilizations.\
Today, we face new threats from rogue regimes like North Korea, Iran, and Syria, and the governments that finance and support them. \'a0We also face grave threats from terrorist organizations that wage war on innocent lives. \'a0Tomorrow will mark one year since a joyous Bastille Day celebration in Nice turned into a massacre. \'a0We all remember that, how horrible that was. \'a0We mourn the 86 lives that were stolen, and we pray for their loved ones. \'a0We also renew our resolve to stand united against these enemies of humanity and to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and ideological support. \'a0\'a0\
Today, President Macron and myself discussed how we can strengthen our vital security partnerships. \'a0We just had a meeting with our generals and our representatives, and it went very well. \'a0France has excellent counterterrorism capabilities. The French troops are serving bravely in places like Mali to defeat these forces of murder and destruction. \'a0The United States and our allies strengthen our commitments to defeat terrorism. \'a0\
We\'92re also making tremendous progress. \'a0Earlier this week, with the strong support of the United States and the Global Coalition, Iraqi forces liberated the city of Mosul from ISIS control. \'a0Now we must work with the government of Iraq and our partners and allies in the region to consolidate the gains and ensure that the victory stays a victory, unlike the last time.\
Last week, the G20 leaders also reaffirmed the right to sovereign nations to control their borders. \'a0We must be strong from within to defend ourselves from threats from the outside. \'a0The nations of the West also face domestic challenges of our own creation, including vast government bureaucracy that saps the strength from our economies and from our societies. \'a0\
For this reason, I applaud President Macron on his courageous call for that \'93less bureaucracy\'94 -- it\'92s a good chant -- "less bureaucracy," -- we can use it, too -- and a Europe that protects its citizens. \'a0We did not become great through regulation. \'a0And in the United States, Mr. President, we also have cut regulations at a level we\'92ve never seen before. \'a0So we\'92re very proud of that -- over the last six months -- but by allowing our people to follow their dreams. \'a0That\'92s what it\'92s all about. \'a0To achieve these dreams, however, we must also confront unfair trade practices that hurt our workers, and pursue trade deals that are reciprocal and fair.\'a0\
Both President Macron and I understand our responsibility to prioritize the interests of our countries and, at the same time, to be respectful of the world in which we live. \'a0We live in a very complex world. \'a0We have to respect it. \'a0The United States remains committed to being a leader in environmental protection, while we advance energy security and economic growth. \'a0\
The friendship between our two nations -- and ourselves, I might add -- is unbreakable. \'a0Our occasional disagreements are nothing compared to the immortal bonds of culture, destiny, and liberty that unite us. \'a0So strongly unite us, also. \'a0As long as we have pride in who we are, where we\'92ve come from, how we got here, and what we\'92ve achieved as free and democratic nations, then there is nothing we cannot accomplish together. \'a0\
France helped us secure our independence. \'a0A lot of people forget. \'a0In the American Revolution, thousands of French soldiers fought alongside American troops so that, as Lafayette said, liberty would have a country. \'a0Ever since then, courageous heroes from both nations have fought for the same noble values and the same righteous cause. \'a0\
Tomorrow, the French Tricolor will once again wave proudly alongside the American Stars and Stripes. \'a0Our brave soldiers will march side-by-side, and we will all be inspired to protect and cherish the birthright of freedom that our ancestors won for us with their sweat and with their blood.\
President Macron, thank you for inviting Melania and myself to this historic celebration. \'a0And to you and your spectacular country: \'a0May God bless France and may God bless America. \'a0\
Thank you very much. \'a0Thank you. \'a0Thank you, Mr. President. \'a0\uc0\u8232 \'a0\'a0\u8232 PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0He's getting first question, President?\
And now, President Trump, is it possible for you to come back to the Paris Accord and change your mind?\
Next, regarding your relation, how would you describe it today? \'a0What about the dinner tonight? \'a0Is it going to be a dinner between friends? \'a0\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0I think that I can reiterate. \'a0We have a very good relationship, a good friendship. \'a0And we look forward to dinner tonight at the Eiffel Tower. \'a0That will be something special. \'a0And, yeah, I mean, something could happen with respect to the Paris Accord. \'a0We'll see what happens. \'a0But we will talk about that over the coming period of time. \'a0And if it happens, that will be wonderful. \'a0And if it doesn\'92t, that will be okay, too. \'a0But we'll see what happens.\'a0\
But we did discuss many things today, including the ceasefire in Syria. \'a0We discussed the Ukraine. \'a0We discussed a lot of different topics. \'a0We briefly hit on the Paris Accord. \'a0And we'll see what happens.\
Yes, ma'am. \'a0Go ahead.\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0Well, I'll start off by saying, first of all, I believe that we will have a great FBI director. \'a0I think he's doing really well, and we're very proud of that choice. \'a0I think I've done a great service to the country by choosing him. \'a0He will make us all proud, and I think someday we'll see that -- and hopefully someday soon. \'a0So, we're very proud of him.\
As far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man. \'a0He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. \'a0It was a short meeting. \'a0It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast. \'a0Two of the people in the room, they -- I guess one of them left almost immediately and the other one was not really focused on the meeting.\
I do think this: \'a0I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. \'a0It's called opposition research, or even research into your opponent. \'a0I've had many people -- I have only been in politics for two years, but I've had many people call up -- "Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person, or, frankly, Hillary." \'a0That's very standard in politics. \'a0Politics is not the nicest business in the world, but it's very standard where they have information and you take the information.\
In the case of Don, he listened. \'a0I guess they talked about -- as I see it, they talked about adoption and some things. \'a0Adoption wasn\'92t even a part of the campaign. \'a0But nothing happened from the meeting. \'a0Zero happened from the meeting. \'a0And, honestly, I think the press made a very big deal over something that, really, a lot of people would do.\'a0\
Now, the lawyer that went to the meeting, I see that she was in the halls of Congress, also. \'a0Somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. \'a0Now, maybe that's wrong. \'a0I just heard that a little while ago. \'a0But a little surprised to hear that. \'a0So she was here because of Lynch.\
So, again, I have a son who's a great young man. \'a0He's a fine person. \'a0He took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia. \'a0It lasted for a very short period, and nothing came of the meeting. \'a0And I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken.\'a0\
Mr. President.\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0What a good answer that was. \'a0(Laughter.)\'a0\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0One of the great things that came out of that meeting, by the way -- even though it\'92s not part of the question -- was the fact that we got a ceasefire that now has lasted for, I guess, Mr. President, almost five days. \'a0And while five days doesn\'92t sound like a long period of time, in terms of a ceasefire in Syria, that\'92s a very long period of time. \'a0And that was a result of having communication with a country. \'a0So, during that five-day period, a lot of lives have been saved. \'a0A lot of people were not killed. \'a0No shots have been fired in a very, very dangerous part of the world, and this is one of the most dangerous parts of Syria itself. \'a0\
So by having some communication and dialogue, we were able to have this ceasefire, and it\'92s going to go on for a while. \'a0And, frankly, we\'92re working on a second ceasefire in a very rough part of Syria. \'a0And if we get that and a few more, all of a sudden you\'92re going to have no bullets being fired in Syria. \'a0And that would be a wonderful thing.\
Mr. President, you have a question.\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0 You better let me answer that one first. \'a0That\'92s a beauty. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0He\'92s the one that asked the question. \'a0That wasn\'92t even one of my picks. \'a0\
You know what, it\'92s going to be just fine because you have a great President. \'a0You have somebody that\'92s going to run this country right. \'a0And I would be willing to bet -- because I think this is one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities in the world -- and you have a great leader now, you have a great President, you have a tough President. \'a0He\'92s not going to be easy on people that are breaking the laws and people that show this tremendous violence. \'a0\
So I really have a feeling that you\'92re going to have a very, very peaceful and beautiful Paris, and I\'92m coming back. \'a0You better do a good job, please. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0Otherwise you\'92re going to make me look very bad.\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0Thank you.\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0Well, he\'92s a friend of mine. \'a0I have great respect for him. \'a0We\'92ve gotten to know each other very well. \'a0A great leader. \'a0He\'92s a very talented man. \'a0I think he\'92s a very good man. \'a0He loves China, I can tell you. \'a0He loves China. \'a0He wants to do what\'92s right for China. \'a0\
We\'92ve asked him for some assistance with respect to North Korea. \'a0Probably, he could do a little bit more, but we\'92ll find out. \'a0We\'92re now working on some trade deals. \'a0He\'92s been very nice. \'a0He\'92s let, as you know, beef go back in, certain financing go back in, credit card financing, and various other things go back in at my request, which is a great thing for our farmers. \'a0A lot of good things are happening, but we\'92re going to be working on some very major trade components. \'a0\
But President Xi is a terrific guy. \'a0I like being with him a lot, and he\'92s a very special person. \'a0\
Okay, thank you. \'a0\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0Thank you very much. \'a0Great honor. \'a0Thank you. \'a0 \'a0\
